# Machine Failure Prediction 

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts machine failures using the **ai4i2020.csv** dataset. By predicting machine failures, we can help prevent downtime and reduce maintenance costs in industrial settings.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - ai4i2020](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset)
- **Description:**  The dataset consists of 10,000 rows (data points) and 14 columns (features), capturing sensor data from industrial machines.

## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to predict tool wear failures in milling machines based on sensor data.
- Reduce production downtime and maintenance costs through early prediction of tool wear.
